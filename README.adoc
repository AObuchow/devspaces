### What's inside?

This repository hosts CodeReady Workspaces assembly that mainly inherits Eclipse Che artifacts and repackages some of them:

Differences as compared to upstream:

* Customized Dashboard (pics, icons, titles, loaders, links)
* Samples and Stacks modules
* Bayesian Language Server and agent
* Product Info plugin (IDE customizations: pics, titles links)
* Custom Dockerfile based on official RH OpenJDK image from RHCC

NOTE: Dockerfiles in this repo are NOT the ones used to build RHCC container images in OSBS.

### How to Build

#### Pre-reqs

JDK 1.8+
Maven 3.5+

#### Build Assembly

Run the following command in the root of a repository:

```
mvn clean install
```

NOTE: Since the build includes GWT compilation it may take more than 3 minutes to complete.

The build artifact used in the Docker image will be in `assembly/assembly-main/target/codeready-${version}/codeready-${version}`

* http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/containers/codeready-workspaces/tree/Dockerfile?h=codeready-1.0-rhel-7


### How to Build Container Using Jenkins and OSBS (Brew)

See this document for more on how to use those build systems, in order to publish a container image to Red Hat Container Catalog:
