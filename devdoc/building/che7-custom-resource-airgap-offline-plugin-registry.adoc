= Deploying Che 7 with an offline plugin registry

Unlike link:che7-minishift-deployment.adoc[Deploying Che 7 to Minishift 1.34+] and link:che7-custom-resource-airgap.adoc[Deploying Che 7 with custom images], this doc will explain how to do an Eclipse Che 7 deployment with a a plugin registry container that contains all the plugins and icons local to the container.

The purpose of this approach is to ensure that the plugin registry's references are self-contained, rather than pointing outside the container to pull 3rd party content. This is in support of an *air gap environment*, where an organization cannot directly see Github.com or Eclipse.org, and must instead use previously proxied / mirrored artifacts within their organization's firewall.

== Prerequisites

You need the latest link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases[Minishift] and link:https://github.com/che-incubator/chectl/releases[chectl] releases.

See link:che7-custom-resource-airgap.adoc[Deploying Che 7 with custom images] for details.

== Procedure

. Start up minishift. (See link:building-crw.adoc#start-up-minishift[Start up Minishift] for some suggested default settings.) 
+
```
minishift start
```

. Log in once startup is complete.
+
```
oc login 192.168.MY.IP:8433 -u system -p admin
```

. For Eclipse Che 7, pull link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-operator/blob/master/pkg/deploy/defaults.go[these images] and link:che7-custom-resource-airgap-pull-rename-push.sh[publish them] to your internal registry:

* eclipse/che-server:nightly
* eclipse/che-keycloak:nightly
* quay.io/eclipse/che-devfile-registry:nightly
* centos/postgresql-96-centos7:latest
* registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8-minimal:8.0

. Build a forked version of the link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry[quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-registry:nightly] from link:https://github.com/nickboldt/containers/tree/master/che-plugin-registry-airgap[che-plugin-registry-airgap]. 
. The result of the build can be seen as link:https://quay.io/repository/nickboldt/che-pluginregistry[`quay.io/nickboldt/che-pluginregistry:nightly`].

[IMPORTANT]
====
What's different in the fork?

... The Dockerfile is based on ubi8-minimal, then adds httpd and yq for yaml parsing
... A new script `fetch_resources.sh` is run, which collects the .theia, .vsix, and .svg files referenced from external sites and saves them inside the container in a resources/ folder. This folder is then exposed via the httpd server. Part of the process of collecting the images replaces references to https://github.com with http://0.0.0.0/resources/github.com.
... A new script `fetch_containers.sh` lists, but *does not collect* the external containers needed by plugins in the registry as sidecars or runtimes.
... When the container is deployed into a pod, it will look in its environment for `CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN\__REGISTRY__URL`. If found, it will replace all occurences of 0.0.0.0 in meta.yaml and index.json files with the value of `CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN\__REGISTRY__URL` so that the plugin broker can look into the plugin registry to resolve the plugin files. This is handled by `replace_0.0.0.0.sh`, called by the container's entrypoint script.
====

[start=6]
. Create a link:che7-custom-resource-airgap-offline-plugin-registry.yaml[custom resource file], which overrides the default image values from link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-operator/blob/master/pkg/deploy/defaults.go[che-operator defaults.go] to use your custom registry's images, including the all-in-one plugin registry fork above.
+
[NOTE]
====
To watch the events and verify which images are pulled, see link:che7-minishift-images.adoc[this document] before performing the next step.
====

. Deploy Che to minishift using the custom resource file created above, link:che7-custom-resource-airgap-offline-plugin-registry.yaml[`che7-custom-resource-airgap-offline-plugin-registry.yaml`]. In this example the namespace `che-op` is used instead of the default `che`:
+
```
chectl server:start -a operator -p minishift -n che-op \
  --che-operator-cr-yaml=che7-custom-resource-airgap-offline-plugin-registry.yaml
```
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use the minishift addon to deploy Che (which uses a deployment configuration instead of an operator), your custom resource file will not be used. The addon is deprecated.
====

. You should see this:
+
image:../images/che7-custom-resource-chectl.png[Console output]

. Once deployed, you should see these in your Minishift console:
+
image:../images/che7-custom-resource-chectl-deployed.png[]

. The custom image reference can be seen in the yaml for the deployment:
+ 
image:../images/che7-custom-resource-deployed-view-config.png[]

. Next, inject the environment variable for your plugin registry deployment's route URL into the config and wait until it's redeployed.
+
```
routebits=$(oc get routes | grep plugin-registry);
route=( $routebits );
regurl=${route[1]};
oc set env deployment/plugin-registry CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__REGISTRY__URL=${regurl}
```
+
You can verify it worked after a few minutes like this:
+
```
oc rsh $(oc get pods | grep plugin-registry | grep Running | sed -e "s# \+1/1.\+##") \
/bin/bash -c "env | grep CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__REGISTRY__URL"
```

. Now that you've made it work locally, you can deploy to an OCP cluster instead of Minishift! It's almost the same command but you have to specify the platform (`-p` or `--platform=`) as `openshift` and define the domain to which to push the deployment (using `-b` or `--domain=`):
+
```
chectl server:start -a operator -p openshift -n che-on-ocp \
  -b console-openshift-console.apps.crw.codereadyeq.com \
  --che-operator-cr-yaml=che7-custom-resource-airgap-offline-plugin-registry.yaml 
```
