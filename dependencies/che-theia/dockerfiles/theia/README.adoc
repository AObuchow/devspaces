## Build che-theia theia image

To run this build locally using RHEL dependencies:

```
./build.sh --dockerfile:rhel.Dockerfile
```

To run this build in order to collect dependencies needed to run in Brew:

```
./build.sh --offline --dockerfile:rhel.Dockerfile
```

Note that this build depends on the creation and publication of the theia-dev image, which is currently being published here:

```
registry-proxy.engineering.redhat.com/rh-osbs/codeready-workspaces-theia-dev-rhel8:2.0
```

If building `theia-dev` locally, you can override that value using:

```
FROM ${BUILD_ORGANIZATION}/${BUILD_PREFIX}-theia-dev:${BUILD_TAG}
```
